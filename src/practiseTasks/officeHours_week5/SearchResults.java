	Note: make the program as dynamic as possible for different sizes
	(it could be a number of 10 which is only 2 number digits or 100000 which is 6 number digits)

	Fixed format of the String:
		Total results found: $results. Sort, Filter, Ratings

	ex:
		"Total results found:3012. Sort, Filter, Ratings"
		-> 3012

		"Total results found:25. Sort, Filter, Ratings"
		-> 25

	Q: what is the datatype of the number we are getting in the end?
		Follow up, we will learn how to get this as an integer number in the future*/
