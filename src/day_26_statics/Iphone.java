     So, we don't need any object reference.

We can only declare static variables at the class level.

We can access static fields without object initialization.

Finally, we can access static fields using an object reference (such as ford.numberOfCars++).
But we should avoid this because it becomes difficult to figure out if itâ€™s an instance variable or a class variable.
 Instead, we should always refer to static variables using the class name (Car.numberOfCars++).*/
